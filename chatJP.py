#     You are being invited to participate in a research study conducted by Dr. Yuta Kawamura (Osaka Metropolitan University, Osaka, Japan). 
#                 If you have any questions or concerns about this study, feel free to contact the researchers via Prolific system.  

#     **Purpose of the Study:** This study explores how people interact in casual group conversations. 
    
#     **Procedures:** If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will complete a brief online interaction. 
#                 The process takes approximately 7~8 minutes to complete.  
    
#     **Requirements:** All participants must be Prolific participants, and be at least 18 years of age.
    
#     **Potential Risks and Discomforts:** You may get tired, but it should not exceed those experienced in everyday life.

#     **Potential Benefits to Participants and/or to Society:** You will receive no personal benefits for participating (other than compensation ‚Äì see below). Your participation will contribute to ongoing academic research.

#     **Compensation for Participants:** For participating in this study, you will receive a base pay of ¬£1.20.
    
#     **Confidentiality:** This study is conducted solely for academic research purposes. Therefore, the data collected from this study will be anonymised to ensure confidentiality, and no analysis will be performed that could lead to identification of individuals. While the raw data may be disclosed upon submission to academic journals, it will not be made public in a manner that could identify individuals. In the case that the data is not made public, the data will be retained by the researchers for up to 30 years before permanently deleted.

#     **Use of Generative AI:** In this study, you will be interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) agents in a simulated group chat. The text you enter during the chat will be processed by Generative AI models to produce responses in real time. In addition, your input may later be analysed using Generative AI tools for research purposes. Only the text you write during the experiment will be entered into the AI system. No personally identifiable information, such as your Prolific ID, will be included. Your input will be used to help improve our understanding of group communication. By continuing, you consent to both interacting with AI agents and having your written responses analysed using Generative AI.
                
#     **Participation and Withdrawal:** Participation in this study is not obligatory. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any point. Should you decide to discontinue the participation, you may do so by closing the browser. Data that is partially completed will be temporarily saved online but will be promptly discarded and not be subjected to analysis.

#     **Rights of Research Participants:** This project has been reviewed by the Osaka Metropolitan University Research Ethics Board for research involving human participants.
           
#     If you choose to continue to the study, the experimenter will assume that you consent to participate in this research.

#     Note: Please note that you can print a copy of this consent form for your records.
